        <p>
          The <strong>Billiard Club App</strong> is designed to make billiard games more organized and enjoyable.
          It helps you keep track of wins and losses, while ensuring every player gets a fair chance to compete.
        </p>

            <p>
            The app features a well-structured algorithm that ensures all players will play against one another, 
            with no same opponent appearing consecutively. It includes a weighting system that pairs winners 
            more frequently after everyone has had a chance to play.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is flexible: players can be added or removed at any time without affecting the algorithm's capacity to
              evenly match players. Whether youâ€™re hosting a friendly billiard tournament or tracking regular games at
              your club, this app simplifies player management and provides an engaging way to stay on top of the
              competition!

          <p>
            The app features a well-structured algorithm that guarantees all players will play with one another at
            least once, while allowing flexibility in player additions or removals.
